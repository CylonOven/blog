Added a crontab that copies my spam folder to SR and has spamassasin learn from the mailbox::
    $ scp /home/tonis/.thunderbird/r6zecrb3.default/Mail/mail.saffre-rumma-2.net/Trash.sbd/Spam saffre-rumma.net:/home/tonis; ssh saffre-rumma.net sa-learn --spam --mbox Spam -D

Mailbox

Spam...
I don't want messages that include SA's spam subject to be entered into the databace, however due to the logic of
django mail if the enter condition is not met, that message is just skipped not deleted. So I believe I have to use a different method.

I'm thinking of injecting a new field into messages bool:spam, and on entery mark it as such, then every week delete messages that are spam or just have an action

Injecting failed, I beleive it's because it's not a virtual field
