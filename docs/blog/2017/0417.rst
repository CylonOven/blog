Vote Summary
============
Looked into how lino generates it's workflow_buttons.

I updated the get_slave_summary for votes so that the action buttons for the acted user also apear on the summary.
However this caused the start session action along with edit vote button to apear as well as the state_change actions.

I decided that I would look at how they are generated in get_workflow_buttons, and copy it to my needs rather than my
other idea of having another parameter to get_workflow_buttons for showing only state_change actions.

Courses
=======

Not seeing MyEnrolments table showing up in jane.
I added it to the menu-bar. And this led me down a debugging run of the table.
I had incorrectly set-up the new parameter and default parameter value, which caused some unusual errors.

Comments Via Workflow
=====================

After learning how the workflow buttons work I was able to add another button to insert a new comment into the workflow
actions field. I rather like the result.
