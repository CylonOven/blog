Looks like the view sourse on luc's blog works only when he's committed the docs to the git repo.
So I can use it as reference, but only on older posts.

Also learned the correct way to link to a ticket.
::

    :ticket:`1597`

Renders to:

:ticket:´1597´

So I went back and fixed the markup for my olders posts.

However another problem, rst markup uses the ` not ' or ", and ` is being used for my guake shortcut.
Looks af if this is somewhat of a usual problem with other keyboards and the back-tick `See <http://http://docutils.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html#how-can-i-generate-backticks-using-a-scandinavian-keyboard/>`_

I moved my guake shortcut to f3 inorder to be able to type '`'. Another option is the use::

    ctrl + shift + u 60
