Lino Extjs & CSS
----------------
Finally got the CSS and of a disabled detail looking proper when viewed
by a basic user. Sadly I couldn't change the background color of the
Detail field, since it's an iframe that contains another document.

That's quite a hard to to fix, perhaps a way to denote that it's
disalbed is hiding the toolbar?

The DXM100 and sockets.
-----------------------
Spent most of my time creating an API for the DXM100's TCP connection.

I'm rather happy with what's writen.

Eric was confused as to why everything were class methods. But I'm
thinking the api might be instantiated with a MNID, that way it's clear
or not if that DXM is setup correctly for TCP connections ,rather then
just returning False for each request.

Also it might be useful to have a way to send several requests on a
single conneciton. However this is not important.

Eric just needs to get the UI to update nicely and that's it.
