Today we visited Muhu since Siiri had a wedding she had to shoot there.
I looked into the chooser for timezone on jane. There is a bug there
that is allowing invalid values to be passed, as well as now allowing me
to search past the first page.

Also I had a go at one of projecteuler problems, #61.
Took me ~2 hours to code a solution. https://projecteuler.net/problem=61

This weekend I'm going to add it to my Squish Git.
