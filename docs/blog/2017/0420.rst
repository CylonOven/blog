Exercise
=========

Haven't been training at all for the past year really, I rather not become the stereotypical new father who puts on
several kgs and never works out again.

To combat this, I wrote a small bash script:

for i in `seq 1 10`; do espeak "Time To Do 5 Pushups"; sleep 3; for x in `seq 1 5`; do espeak hop; sleep .5; espeak $x; sleep .5; done; espeak "good job"; sleep 180; done
