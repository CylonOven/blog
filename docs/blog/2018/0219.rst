ImportError: No module named invlib.ns
======================================

Fixed an issue I was having with Atelier::

    ImportError: No module named invlib.ns

Seems that Luc did some refactoring and moved the invlib.ns module out of the lino package and into atelier,
He updated the tasks.py files for all his repos, but he missed some which I still had floating around: Riche and Presto.

To fix it all I had to do was update the tasks.py file::

    # lino.invlib.ns import ns #Wrong
    from atelier.invlib.ns import ns #Right


Now `pp -l` works along with `pp git pull`.
