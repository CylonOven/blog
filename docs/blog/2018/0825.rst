Mystery disks
=============

both sdh anf sdi are refusing to mount.
Any attempt to mount were met with a drive or mountpoint busy error.

df, fdisk -l, gparted gave no usful info what was thw issue.

however lsblk said that those two drives had raid configuratuons.

`dmraid -r confirmed this.`

https://www.slac.stanford.edu/grp/cd/soft/unix/RAIDmetadata.html

was helpful in solving the issue.

`dmraid -r -E /dev/sdi and sdh`

gave the same error as in the above link.

`dmraid -E remove /dev/maper/ddfq\_...`

One other command I learned is `fuser` for seeing whos locking a file or device.
