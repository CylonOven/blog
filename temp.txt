This is a new test of the Das keyboard Ultimate 4.

Previosly it was having an unusual falt. Sometimes when releasing a key the computer would not register the key-up event. 
Causing the computer to think the key was held down when it wasn't. Very annoying, expessialy when the key is a modifer like CTRL or ALT.
So when you would alt-tab away the alt would be held,cauing all sorts of odd behavior. 

I pulled the whole keyboard apart to try to find the issue, also fixed the alt key, as it was not working.
The alt key had corroded together, making it not work at all. I opened it up and cleaned it, however I think in bending the bits I somehow messed it up as it doesn't click anymore.
If it bothers me I'll switch it out with a new one or with a unused key such as print-screen or something. 

After cleaning it all over with alcohol, including the PCB, (which caused the volume nob to get a but gunky) testing the switching during falut (They were open), and putting it back together it still didn't work right.

Next day I spent a long time looking for a new keyboard. 

I found the GENESIS RX85 keyboard with Blue knock-off chery switches. for 58 EUR on ArvuITark.
It's a full size board with a volume knob and backlighting. 

But I was curious to see if the Das didn't work right on the laptop too. 

So I set it up and tried... Nope, no problems. 
Reboot Pluto and plugged it back in... no more problems.

Aaaaaa

Why didn't I think of rebooting sooner? Aaaaaa. 

Two new rules for myself.

1. When a device gets wet; remove all power sources asap. 
2. If Pluto or any computer has a odd problem... reboot...
